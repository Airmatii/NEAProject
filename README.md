# Hello OCR examiner and Ms. Sequiera,

Unfortunately, due to optimisation issues, the only thing I'm afraid you can access without any complications, are my report. And maybe you can open the assets I've used for my map

Reason saying so is, whenever I try compile, it'll crash so ultimately I cannot physically show you my game yet, it will be done before Easter ends

Ms. Sequiera, I'm going to need by the end of Easter Break to try bug fix and optimise and refine my project, hopefully you understand. 
As I'm optimising my project, it'll also require me to update my report in the meantime. Thank you for bearing with me.
I'd say this is my NEA Project at around 70% completion.

However, examiner, to try and attempt to look at the file, you'll need:
Unreal Engine 4.26.2 (this exact version)
You may also need Visual Studio Code, in order to look at my source code C++ for his movement mechanics. 
You can find that at: JoshuaNEAProject -> UnrealEngine(Game+Map+Assets) -> Source -> SonicNEA -> DashCharacterMovementComponent
both the .cpp and .h
And to access my Underground Base Map Assets: JoshuaNEAProject -> MapAssets
You'll be able to view the fbx file, which will automatically uploads its textures too.
