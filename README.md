However, examiner, to try and attempt to look at the file, you'll need:
Unreal Engine 4.26.2 (this exact version)
You may also need Visual Studio Code, in order to look at my source code C++ for his movement mechanics. 
You can find that at: JoshuaNEAProject -> UnrealEngine(Game+Map+Assets) -> Source -> SonicNEA -> DashCharacterMovementComponent
both the .cpp and .h
You can find assets I've made in the updated project link
And to access my Underground Base Map Assets: JoshuaNEAProject -> MapAssets
You'll be able to view the fbx file, which will automatically uploads its textures too.
