Exporting my .uproject is the problem that occurs, which was giving me difficulties submitting on time. 
Due to me not being able to export, due to various issues as assets glitching, and some blueprints not working as expected. I decided to show videos of me showing how my project runs. With 3 maps. Each video showcasing different abilities, and scenarios
Here you'll see maps, a GUI (homing attack chains, score, rings, and end result screen), enemies, Sonic's movement and etc
This is prior to the Easter Break. After the break I'll add more stuff, for instance: More Sonic attacks, Bigger map, harder and more diverse enemies
